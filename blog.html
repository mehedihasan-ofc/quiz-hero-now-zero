                forEach()?</h2>
            <p class="leading-8"><span class="bg-green-600 text-white px-2 rounded">Answer:</span> map(): executes the
                same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements. filter():
                checks every element in an array to see if it meets certain criteria and returns a new array. If no
                value matches the condition, an empty array is returned. find(): method returns the first element in the
                given array that matches the condition. If no value matches the condition, undefined is returned.
                forEach(): is used to execute the same code on every element in an array and it returns undefined.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium mb-3">02. What is the difference between localStorage, sessionStorage and
                cookies?</h2>
            <p class="leading-8"><span class="bg-green-600 text-white px-2 rounded">Answer:</span> localStorage,
                sessionStorage, and cookies are all used to store data on the client side, but they have some important
                differences.

                localStorage: This is a type of storage that allows you to store data in the browser permanently. This
                means that the data you store will persist even if the user closes their browser and comes back at a
                later time.

                sessionStorage: This is similar to localStorage, but the data stored in sessionStorage is only available
                for the duration of the browser session. This means that the data is lost when the browser is closed or
                the tab is closed.

                cookies: Cookies are the oldest and most well-known mechanism. They are simple to use and well-supported
                by browsers. However, they are limited to 4KB of data and are often used to store data that is not
                sensitive, such as user preferences.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium mb-3">03. What is an event loop? How does it work?</h2>
            <p class="leading-8"><span class="bg-green-600 text-white px-2 rounded">Answer:</span> The event loop is a
                fundamental concept in JavaScript that plays a crucial role in managing the execution of asynchronous
                code. In JavaScript, code is executed in a single-threaded environment, which means that only one thing can
                happen at a time. Asynchronous code, such as network requests or timers, needs to be executed without
                blocking the main thread. The event loop is responsible for managing the execution of these asynchronous
                tasks. The event loop works by continuously checking the message queue for any pending tasks. When an
                asynchronous task, such as a network request, is completed, it is added to the message queue as an
                event. The event loop then checks the message queue for any pending events and executes them one at a
                time in the order they were added.</p>

            <p class="leading-8"><span class="bg-green-600 text-white px-2 rounded">Answer:</span> Each time 60 seconds are given to answer 6 quizzes. The task of the quizTimer() function is to indicate the red color after counting up to 60 seconds.</p>
